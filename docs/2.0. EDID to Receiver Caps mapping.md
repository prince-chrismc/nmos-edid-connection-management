{:toc}

Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) is a metadata format for an apparatus to describe its capabilities as a video source (e.g. graphics card or set-top box). The data format is defined by a standard published by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). This document is targeted against [E-EDID A2][E-EDID] which consist of EDID 1.4 (and covers EDID 1.3) and is refered to as _Base EDID_ and the [CTA-861-G][CTA-861] Extension Block imposed by HDMI.

Similarly in [BCP-004-01][BCP-004-01] defines a methodology for describing the capabilities Receivers with constraints on streams of compatible [AMWA IS-04][IS-04] Senders.

## Scope

This document provides Best Current Practice guidelines for how to implement a mapping of EDID fields to Receiver Capabilities in order to have a specific way of representing an EDID sink devices through an associated [IS-04][IS-04] Receiver.

## Use of Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119].

## Normative References

These appear at the end of the Markdown source for this document, and are referenced as hyperlinks within the main body.

## Definitions

_See also the [NMOS Glossary](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/branches/main/docs/4.0._Glossary.html), and definitions within RFCs._

### Gateway Device

A device which encapsulates a digital video or/and audio signal (usually, from a physical connection) into IP packets. Conversely, the device MAY perform the reverse operation for IP packets to a digital signal.

- ✖️ This is only applicable to receivers, the definitions needs to only be one way

1. A device which removes the encapsulation of a digital video or/and audio signal from a stream of IP packets.
1. A device which removes the encapsulation of a digital video or/and audio signal from a stream of IP packets to be retransmitted over a baseband connection described by an EDID.

### Sink

A media consuming unit described by an EDID which is associated to a Receiver.

## Introduction

The mapping of a Sink's EDID to a Receiver's Capabilities is limited to Gateway Devices that treat signals as immutable. Gateway Devices capable of altering a signal MUST reflect the capabilities of the Receiver including any types of conversion or restrictions. Gateway Devices which support multiple Sinks per Receiver MUST expose the capabilities of the Receiver if any internal processing occures (e.g. the Receiver is able to consume 4K Flow and downscale it for the Sink who's EDID describes support up to HD resolutions).

- Fix wording

## Video Receivers

If an [IS-04][IS-04] Video Receiver is associated with a Sink which has EDID, its supported video formats MUST be mapped into Receiver's Capabilities according to the rules below.

### Video timings

Video timings, described in [E-EDID][E-EDID], provide information about video frame size and rate. There are multiple blocks which keep information about timings each with their own mapping requirements.

Each video timing MUST be present in the Receiver's Capabilities as a Constraint Set with a non-empty

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width`
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height`
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate`

The timing descriptors MAY include one or more of the following mappings

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode`
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:preference`

#### Established Timings I, II & III

Each Established Timing is an ID associated with a predefined frame width, height and rate and interlace mode. Mapping the first two types are defined in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.8 and the last in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.10.3.9.

<details><summary>Example: Established Timings I & II</summary>

For example, given the three bytes of Established Timings I & II were `20 08 00` then the receiver capabilies could contain the following in its constraint sets

```json
[
  {
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width": {
      "enum": [ 640 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height": {
      "enum": [ 480 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode": {
      "enum": [ "progressive" ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate": {
      "enum": [ { "numerator": 60 } ]
    }
  },
  {
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width": {
      "enum": [ 1024 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height": {
      "enum": [ 768 ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode": {
      "enum": [ "progressive" ]
    },
    "urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate": {
      "enum": [ { "numerator": 60 } ]
    }
  }
]
```

</details>

#### Standard Timings

Standard Timing format is defined in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.9. The mapping to containts is as follows:

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width` MUST be calculated from the _Horizontal Active Pixel Count_
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height` MUST be calculated using the _Frame Width_ and _Image Aspect Ratio_
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate` MUST be calculated with _Field Refresh Rate_

#### Detailed Timing Descriptors (18 Byte Descriptors)

Defined in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.10, there a 4 possible descriptors which can be provided. The first, _Prefered Timing Mode_ is an obligation and MUST have a `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:preference` value off `100`.

The mapping is defined in section 3.10.2 and is applied as follows:

* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:interlace_mode` MUST be set according to _Signal Interface Type_ defined in table 3.22
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width` MUST be _Horizontal Addressable Video in pixels_
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height` MUST be calculated using the _Vertical Addressable Video in lines_ which MUST be multiplied by 2 when _Signal Interface Type_ indicates interlaced
* `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate` SHALL be accurately represented by
  * `numerator` MUST be calculated using _Pixel Clock_
  * `denominator` MUST be calculated with _Horizontal Addressable Video in pixels_, _Horizontal Blanking in pixels_, _Vertical Addressable Video in lines_ and _Vertical Blanking in lines_

#### 3 Byte CVT Codes

- ❗ Never seen, EDID 1.4 or greate
- ↪️ Suggest removing

3 Byte CVT Code structure is defined in [E-EDID][E-EDID] section 3.10.3.8.

Frame height MUST be calculated using the following formula: Frame height = (12BV + 1) × 2, where 12BV is the 12 bit value of a CVT Code. It MUST go into `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_height`.

Frame width MUST be calculated using the following formula: Frame width = 8 × ROUNDDOWN(FH × AR / 8) where FH is Frame Height, AR is _Aspect Ratio_ and ROUNDDOWN is rounding down to the nearest integer. It MUST go into `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:frame_width`.

_Preferred Vertical Rate_ united with the frame width and height makes a Constraint Set.

Each _Supported Vertical Rate_ except the same value as _Preferred Vertical Rate_ MUST be extracted to a new Constraint Set with the same frame width and height.

#### :new: DMT Standard Codes & IDs Summary

MUST be taken into account `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate` as per [DMT][DMT] Section 2 and Section 4

For not CVT complaiant codes, the computed vertical refresh rate MUST be used inplace for the lexcial Timing Name value.

Par exemple : EDID ID: `DMT ID: 02h; STD 2 Byte Code: (31, 19)h; CVT 3 Byte Code: n/a`
640 x 480 @ 72 Hz Ver Frequency = 72.809;
`{ "numerator": 72809, "denominator": 1000 }` for `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:grain_rate`

Exactly

#### Video Data Block

Video Data Block is defined in [CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.1.

It operates with Video Identification Codes (VICs), each of them is associated with a union of frame width, height and rate and interlace mode. This mapping is defined in [CTA-861][CTA-861] section 4.1.

### Color subsampling

If EDID doesn't have the [CTA-861][CTA-861] Extension Block, color subsampling formats MUST be taken from Base EDID, otherwise from the Extenstion Block.

#### Base EDID

The origin of supported color subsampling formats in Base EDID is the Feature Support byte ([E-EDID A2][E-EDID] section 3.6.4).

- ❓ Unclear how to perform this translation
- ↙️ Section 3.7 in E-EDID A1

It has one of four possible values:
* RGB 4:4:4
* RGB 4:4:4 & YCbCr 4:4:4
* RGB 4:4:4 & YCbCr 4:2:2
* RGB 4:4:4 & YCbCr 4:4:4 & YCbCr 4:2:2

This value MUST be transformed into `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:color_sampling` with `enum` type value and added to each Constraint Set.

#### CTA-861 Extension Block

The origin of supported color subsampling formats in CTA-861 is CTA Extension Header ([CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5). Bits 4 and 5 of byte 3 show whether Sink supports YCbCr 4:2:2 and YCbCr 4:4:4 respectively in addition to RGB.

YCbCr 4:2:0 Capability Map Data Block ([CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.11) shows which timings support YCbCr 4:2:0 in addition to subsampling formats listed in CTA Extension Header.

These values MUST be transformed into `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:color_sampling` with `enum` type value and added to each Constraint Set.

YCbCr 4:2:0 Video Data Block ([CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.10) marks timings as supporting only YCbCr 4:2:0.

Constraint Set associated with these timings MUST have `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:color_sampling` equal to `YCbCr-4:2:0`.

### Preference order

If CTA-861 Extension Block is present and contains Video Format Preference Data Block (see [CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.12), it MUST be used to fill `urn:x-nmos:cap:meta:preference`.

Otherwise, the following preference order SHOULD be used:

1. The 1st Detailed Timing Descriptor (Preferred Timing Mode).
2. Other Detailed Timing Descriptors in the order listed in Base EDID.
3. Any additional Detailed Timing Descriptors (priority is in the order listed) in CTA-861 Extension.
4. Short Video Descriptors in the order listed in CTA-861.
5. Any 3 Byte CVT Codes listed in Base EDID. Constraint Sets with _Preferred Vertical Rate_ MUST go first, then the rest in the order of descence of frame rate.
6. Standard Timings listed in Base EDID.
7. Established Timings listed in Base EDID.

## Audio Receivers

If Basic Audio support bit is active in CTA Extension Header, audio receiver MUST have Receiver Caps.

If there is no any Short Audio Descriptors (see [CTA-861][CTA-861] section 7.5.2), it means 2-channel Linear PCM audio with 8 bit depth, so `caps` attribute of `media_type` MUST contain only `audio/L8`, `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:media_type` MUST be equal to `audio/L8` and `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:channel_count` MUST be equal to 2.

If there are Short Audio Descriptors, then each of them MUST be transformed into a Constraint Set.

_Audio Format Code_ of each Short Audio Descriptor MUST be transformed into an IANA media type if possible, added to `caps` of `media_types` and `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:media_type` of the new Constraint Set. For Linear PCM format bit depth MUST be read from the third Short Audio Descriptors byte and used for building the IANA media type.

Number of channels MUST go to `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:channel_count`.

All sampling frequencies MUST go to `urn:x-nmos:cap:format:sample_rate` as `enum`.

***

- asci hex folds the raw binary [#38](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-edid-connection-management/issues/38)
- it's not realistic to have the TX taking an `media-essentials` to an EDID (next meeting)
  - Disccused 03-25 --> filter makes sense

- ℹ️ media profile acts like a "filter" on the device
  - copy Decoder EDID and filter in Encouder
  - takes the base "Stock" edid and filters (can adjust prefered mode)

- DisplayID :question:

- CEA Block: Vendor Specific HDMI 1.4b
